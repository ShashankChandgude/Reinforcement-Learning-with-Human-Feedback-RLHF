## Analysis

[POOR] **Poor preference alignment** - The reward model needs significant improvement.
[WARNING] **Moderate text quality** - Generated responses are somewhat coherent.

## Recommendations

1. **Increase training data** - Use more preference examples for better learning.
2. **Longer training** - Train for more epochs to improve convergence.
3. **Larger model** - Consider using a larger base model (7B+ parameters).
4. **Better evaluation** - Add human evaluation for more reliable metrics.
